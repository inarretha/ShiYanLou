## What is LogiTRACE?
 
LogiTRACE is a software that allows you to create 2D developments of 3D parts using a simple and comfortable interface. You can enter your data, see the 3D view and the unfolded part at once and at the same time. You can also save and reload your results, and export them as DXF files for further processing. LogiTRACE can handle complex parts with ease, and it can also consider sheet thickness, welding gaps, seams and folds. LogiTRACE has about 128 standard modules to work with, such as pipes, cones, elbows, transitions, hoppers, etc. You can also create your own modules with Combi-Contour and Combi-Figure tools. LogiTRACE can also read in 3D files created with PROfirst and calculate the unfolded part.
 
## What are the benefits of LogiTRACE?
 
LogiTRACE can help you save time and money by simplifying your engineering and sheet metal work. With LogiTRACE, you can:
 
- Save hours unfolding parts
- Avoid mistakes with the perfect 3D view
- Dimension your parts automatically
- Create segments with common cut and cutting joints
- Mark your folds with different options
- Enter order processing information directly in the DXF file
- Be compatible with nearly all CAD/CAM systems
- Create blocks, e.g. segment bends
