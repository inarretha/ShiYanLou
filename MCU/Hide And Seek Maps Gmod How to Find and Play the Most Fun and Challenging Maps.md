Hide and Seek maps are designed to provide hiding spots, secret passages, and interactive elements for the hiders, as well as challenges, clues, and traps for the seekers. There are hundreds of Hide and Seek maps available on the Steam Workshop, but how do you find and play the best ones?
 
## Step 1: Browse the Steam Workshop
 
The easiest way to find Hide and Seek maps in Gmod is to browse the Steam Workshop, which is a platform where users can upload and download custom content for various games. To access the Steam Workshop, you need to have Steam installed on your computer and own a copy of Garry's Mod.

Once you launch Steam, go to the Library tab and right-click on Garry's Mod. Then, select Manage > Browse Workshop. This will open a new window where you can search for different types of content for Gmod. To filter by Hide and Seek maps, type "Hide and Seek" in the search bar and select Maps under the Categories section. You can also sort the results by popularity, rating, date, or relevance.
 
## Step 2: Subscribe to the Maps You Like
 
When you find a Hide and Seek map that you like, you can view its details by clicking on its thumbnail. You can see screenshots, videos, descriptions, comments, and ratings from other users. If you want to download the map, you need to subscribe to it by clicking on the green +Subscribe button on the right side of the page.
 
Subscribing to a map will automatically download it to your computer and keep it updated whenever the author makes any changes. You can subscribe to as many maps as you want, but keep in mind that some maps may require additional content or addons to work properly. You can check if a map has any dependencies by looking at the Required Items section on its page.
 
## Step 3: Launch Garry's Mod and Play
 
After subscribing to the maps you want, you can launch Garry's Mod and start playing. To play Hide and Seek, you need to either join an online server that hosts the game mode or create your own local server. To join an online server, go to the Find Multiplayer tab and select Hide and Seek under the Game Mode section. You can then browse through a list of servers that are running Hide and Seek maps and join one that suits your preferences.
 
To create your own local server, go to the Start New Game tab and select Hide and Seek under the Game Mode section. You can then choose one of the maps that you subscribed to from the Map section. You can also customize various settings such as max players, round time, gravity, etc. Once you are ready, click on Start Game and invite your friends to join you.
 
## Conclusion
 
Hide and Seek is a fun and exciting game mode that tests your creativity, stealth, and teamwork skills. With so many Hide and Seek maps available on the Steam Workshop, you can enjoy endless hours of hiding and seeking in different environments and scenarios. All you need is Steam, Garry's Mod, and a sense of adventure.
